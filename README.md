Copyright Notice
This is the HTML code for a copyright notice with a date and social media icons.

Usage
To use this code, you can copy and paste it into the HTML file of your website. The copyright notice will display the current year, followed by the name of the company and a statement of ownership. The social media icons link to the company's Facebook and WhatsApp pages.

Customization
You can customize the copyright notice by changing the name of the company in the <p> tag. To add more social media icons, you can add additional <li> elements to the <ul> list in the <div> with the class "social-icons".

Example
Here is an example of how the copyright notice might look on a website:

Copyrights Â© 2023 - All Rights Reserved. | Esppapel S.R.L.

Facebook | WhatsApp

Accessibility
To ensure that the copyright notice is accessible to all users, it is important to include alternative text for the social media icons. This can be done by adding the title attribute to the <i> tags, like this:

<i class="fab fa-facebook-f" title="Facebook"></i> <i class="fab fa-whatsapp" title="WhatsApp"></i>

This will allow screen readers to announce the name of the social media platform when the user hovers over the icon.

Browser Compatibility
This code uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and should be compatible with all modern browsers. However, it is always a good idea to test the code in multiple browsers to ensure that it looks and functions as expected.
